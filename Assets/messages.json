The purpose of this sampling kit is to collect water samples from your home, and then post them back to our laboratory so that we can test the water for lead contents.\n\nYour letting agents, [Lettting Agent Name], have employed us to carry out the lead testing for their properties. Accordingly, please could you collect water samples by following the instruction manual found inside the kit and post them back to us using the included pre-paid returns label as soon as possible. A video guide on how to collect the samples can be viewed below:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/S3yWIWTO8TQ\n\nThis testing is a one-off requirement and has been implemented as a result of the Scottish Government updating the Repairing Standard, where rental properties in Scotland built before 1970 now need their drinking water tested for traces of lead. You can find more information on the legislation by visiting our website:\n\nhttps://www.prnwaterservices.com/the-legislation-information\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us."
