Hi V_1,

Unfortunately, we havenâ€™t received your water samples at our labâ€”they may have gone missing in the post.

As these samples are required for your landlordâ€™s records, weâ€™ll be sending you a replacement water sampling kit this week. It should arrive with you shortly.

If you have any questions or need help with anything, just let us know â€” weâ€™re happy to assist ðŸ˜Š

All the best,
